# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-

Brain tumor segmentation plays a major role in the
diagnosis and treatment of patients. It has improved accuracy and
efficiency in medical imaging. They extract important features
from the Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan. This paper uses
the Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark
(BRATS) 2020 dataset. Various models are trained to analyze
which can give accurate segmentation. The findings contribute to
enhancing clinical and research applications by providing precise
tumor segmentation. This helps in personalized patient care,
ensuring treatment can be tailored to the specific characteristics
of each tumor.In terms of overall performance, Unetr, Unet++,
and Attention Unet performance are extremely good, particularly
in Dice coefficient and mean IOU, making them the top three
models for brain tumor segmentation.
